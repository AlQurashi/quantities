        <!-- Generated by Ddoc from source/quantities/package.d -->
The purpose of this small D package is to perform automatic compile-time or
runtime dimensional checking when dealing with <u>quantities</u> and units.
<br><br>
In order to remain simple, there is no actual distinction between units and
<u>quantities</u>, so there are no distinct quantity and unit types. All operations
are actually done on <u>quantities</u>. For example, `meter` is both the unit meter_
and the quantity 1 m_. New <u>quantities</u> can be derived from other ones using
operators or dedicated functions.
<br><br>

Quantities can be parsed from strings at runtime and compile-time (with
limitations).
<br><br>

The main SI units and prefixes are predefined. Units with other dimensions can
be defined by the user.
